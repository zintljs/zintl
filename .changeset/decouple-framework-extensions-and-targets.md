Evolved the compiler to be completely framework-agnostic (zero-knowledge) by eliminating all default `.vue` and `.svelte` fallbacks from the core extensions and search paths. Configured the host Vite plugin to dynamically calculate target extensions and pass them to the compiler. Refactored the React target adapter matching rule to dynamically exclude registered SFC extensions and HTML files without hardcoding Vue or Svelte.

Abstracted dynamic imports and virtual module paths inside the compiler. Added `resolveVirtualPath` and `dynamicImportTemplate` options callbacks, allowing any host bundler plugin to configure custom virtual namespaces (e.g. queries) and ignore-comments (e.g. webpackIgnore/vite-ignore) dynamically.
