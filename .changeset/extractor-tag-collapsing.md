"@zintl/extractor": patch
---

Optimize HTML and JSX extraction, phrasing-tag normalization, and comment directive handling:

- **Nested Phrasing Tag Support**: Flawlessly parses and normalizes deeply nested phrasing tags (e.g., `<a>read <code>instructions</code></a>`) without disrupting tag open/close balances or generating malformed outputs.
- **Transparent Phrasing Directives**: Allows HTML comment directives (`@zintl-note` and `@zintl-pass`) to live inside phrasing tag boundaries without partitioning the translatable string, propagating meta annotations seamlessly to translators.
