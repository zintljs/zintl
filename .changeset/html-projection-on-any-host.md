Gave the HTML projection a host-neutral path, so `<html lang>`/`dir`, `<title>` and `<meta description>` follow the locale on Rsbuild as they do on Vite.

`compiler.transformHtml()` was always host-neutral; what was not is the only thing that ever called it — Vite's `transformIndexHtml`, which lives in the plugin's `vite` block and which unplugin drops on every other target. Rsbuild's `api.modifyHTML` has the same shape, so this is wiring rather than a second implementation, routed from the plugin's `rsbuild` block. Deliberately **not** a `BundlerFacet` hook: `ContentFacet.transformHtml` already exists and _is_ the projection, so a bundler hook of the same name beside it would reproduce a naming collision this codebase has been bitten by before — and registering `modifyHTML` is plugin work that a facet, being data and string-returning functions, cannot do.

**Two things had to be solved that a straight wiring would not have caught.**

_Identity._ Rsbuild hands the hook an output filename (`index.html`, relative to `dist`) where Vite hands an absolute source path. The projection re-reads the source on a cache miss and computes sink offsets against it, so passing the output name through produces a blank page. It is now inverted through `htmlPaths` and `html.template` back to the source id — and when any step yields nothing, which happens for real when Rsbuild uses its built-in template, it warns and declines rather than silently doing nothing.

_The boundary link._ Zintl learns which scripts a document loads by reading `<script src>` from markup, and turns them into the document's dependencies — which is how a page reaches a trust anchor and becomes a boundary at all. An Rsbuild template names no scripts: the entry is injected at build time from `source.entry`, so the association lives in the build config. With nothing to read, no HTML document reached a boundary on this host, no catalog was ever scaffolded for one, and the direction map came out empty.

`CompilerOptions.htmlEntries` is the new declaration — keyed by html id, valued with source ids, unioned with whatever the markup says and empty on every host whose templates name their own scripts. It updates both `htmlProjection.scripts` and `dependencies`, because the extractor derives the second from the first _during_ extraction and afterwards they are two separate facts.

**Also generalised**: the `locale-switch` contract asserted a request URL containing `virtual:zintl/content/<locale>/`, which is Vite's virtual-module spelling — an Rspack build emits catalogs as ordinary hashed async chunks. The question the contract asks is host-neutral; only the spelling is not, so an optional `LocaleSwitchAdapter.isCatalogRequest` holds the per-project answer and defaults to the Vite form.
