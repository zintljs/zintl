Gave Zintl's option defaults a single home. Defaults were previously applied lazily at roughly thirty read sites across two packages, several of them duplicated with divergent rules, so answering "where did this value come from?" meant grepping.

**`resolveOptions()` is now real.** It had been a stub whose entire body was commented out, returning `options || {}`. It now applies every context-free default once, at plugin creation, and `Context` holds the resulting `ResolvedOptions` so downstream hooks read concrete values. A new exported `DEFAULTS` table is the one place a default is written down.

| default                               | occurrences before | after            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| `locales \|\| ["en"]`                 | 9                  | 0                |
| `sourceLocale \|\| "en"` (plugin)     | 4                  | 0                |
| `similarityThreshold ?? 0.6` literals | 3                  | 0                |
| `["md", "txt"]` literals              | 2                  | 1 named constant |
| harness default blocks                | 2                  | 1                |

**Three defaults stay unresolved on purpose**, because only Vite can supply them. Each is documented in `DEFAULTS` and applied at exactly one site: `multiplex` (`undefined` → auto-detect by scanning entry files), `verifyIntegrity` (`undefined` → on for `build`, off for `serve`) and `logLevel` (`undefined` → fall back to Vite's own, then `"info"`). `logLevel` previously had three stacked defaulting layers and `verifyIntegrity` three rules that disagreed, one of which relied on spread ordering to let a user value win.

`outputDir`, `catalogFormat`, `metadataDir` and `similarityThreshold` are deliberately left unset by the plugin so the compiler applies its own — re-stating them would recreate the duplication being removed.

**Fixed a shared-array aliasing bug** found while writing the new tests: the default `locales` array was a single instance handed to every caller, so one plugin instance mutating its locale list would corrupt another's. Array defaults are now copied per call.

**Compiler-side deduplication.** `DEFAULT_RENAME_THRESHOLD` is exported from `reconcile.ts` and reused by the assets facet, which had hardcoded `0.6` three times. The assets facet's `["md", "txt"]` default is a named constant instead of two inline literals. `AssetFacetConfig` drops its `assetsTarget` alias, so the concept is spelled `targets` at the facet level and `assetsTarget` at the plugin level, bridged in exactly one commented line in `facets/assemble.ts` — previously three spellings reconciled by a rename inside the factory. `IOManager` takes a narrow `IOManagerOptions` (just `metadataDir`) rather than the whole `CompilerOptions`, and its duplicated metadata-directory resolution is collapsed into one method.

**Removed dead configuration.** The `ZINTL_TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` / `ZINTL_TEST_METADATA_DIR` environment overrides were read in `configResolved` but nothing in the repository ever set them. The test harness's Vite alias pointing at `packages/runtime/src/*` referenced a directory that does not exist.

**New coverage** for territory that had none: `resolveOptions` pins every documented default and asserts that falsy user values survive, and `flattenFacets` / `autoFacets` / `assembleFacets` are tested directly — including that `viteFacet()` is always injected and that the generic SSR facet is never paired with Next.js, which would otherwise be a facet conflict.
