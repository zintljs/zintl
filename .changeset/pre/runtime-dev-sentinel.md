Resolve runtime dev branches at build time via a `__ZINTL_DEV__` sentinel.

Every development-only branch in the runtime was guarded like this:

```ts
typeof process !== "undefined" && process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" && this.debug;
```

Vite does replace `process.env` — production output contained `{}.ZINTL_DEBUG === "true"`, proving it. But `typeof process !== "undefined"` sits in front of the replaceable part and cannot be folded, so in a browser it short-circuits to `false` before the replacement is ever reached. **Client-side debug logging has therefore never produced output**, and the guard added for safety was the exact thing defeating the build-time elimination it was meant to enable.

`__ZINTL_DEV__` is now substituted to a literal `true`/`false` by `getRuntimeCode()`, driven by the plugin's `isDev`. A literal is the point: production folds the branch away entirely, development keeps it reachable — on the client as well as the server.

- `getRuntimeCode()` takes a new trailing `isDev` argument, defaulting to `false` so a caller who forgets gets the production runtime. The failure mode is "no debug output", never "debug machinery shipped to users".
- `I18nStore.debug` now also honours `globalThis.__ZINTL_DEBUG` in a browser. The env-var check alone is unreachable client-side, which is the second half of why client logging never appeared.
- Adds a development-only settle beacon: `notify()` increments `globalThis.__zintl_version`, giving test harnesses a causal signal that the store applied something instead of making them sleep and hope. Absent in production by construction.

Verified: production snapshots contain no `console.debug` and no `__zintl_version`, and `debug = typeof process !== "undefined" && {}.ZINTL_DEBUG === "true" || false` now compiles to `debug = false`.

Consumers importing the runtime modules directly (rather than through `getRuntimeCode()`) must define `__ZINTL_DEV__` in their bundler or test config.
