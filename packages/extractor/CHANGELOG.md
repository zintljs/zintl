## 0.1.0-alpha.13

## 0.1.0-alpha.12

## 0.1.0-alpha.11

### Patch Changes

- 7c69554: Updated external dependencies:

  - vite-plus@0.2.7

## 0.1.0-alpha.10

## 0.1.0-alpha.9

## 0.1.0-alpha.8

## 0.1.0-alpha.7

### Minor Changes

- Rename the main package from `zintl` to `zintljs`.

  npm rejects the bare name `zintl` under its package-name similarity filter (`Package name too similar to existing packages intl,vinyl`). The name is unobtainable, so the primary package is now **`zintljs`**, matching the `@zintljs` npm org and the `zintljs` GitHub org.

  **What changed for consumers:**

  ```diff
  - npm install zintl
  + npm install zintljs

  - import zintl from "zintl/vite";
  - import { zintl } from "zintl/macro";
  + import zintl from "zintljs/vite";
  + import { zintl } from "zintljs/macro";
  ```

  **What did not change:** the `zintl()` macro itself. The package name and the exported identifier are deliberately separate — `ZINTL_MACRO` still resolves the `zintl(...)` call expression, and `bindings` in the boundary graph still read `"zintl"`. Only module specifiers moved.

  Internal `virtual:zintl/*` module IDs are unchanged; they are not npm names and keep the project's brand prefix.

  `RUNTIME_PACKAGE` and `RUNTIME_SPECIFIERS` in `@zintljs/extractor`, and `MACRO_PACKAGE` in `@zintljs/compiler`, now point at `zintljs`. Because those constants are baked into the compiler's published output, `@zintljs/compiler@0.1.0-alpha.6` cannot recognize the new specifiers and is superseded by this release.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 448dbc6: Made `@zintljs/extractor` genuinely framework-blind. A previous changeset claimed the extractor had been "fully decoupled" from framework presets; that was inaccurate — the tables were left in place, duplicating the facet presets, and one of them was still on a live code path.

  **Deleted from `targets.ts`:**

  - `TARGET_PRESETS` — full descriptor lists for `vanilla`, `react`, `nextjs`, `vue`, `svelte` and `html`.
  - `TARGET_METADATA` and the `TargetMetadata` type — Vue and Svelte SFC block rules, Svelte's mustache pattern, and the Next.js `generateMetadata` / `generateViewport` suppression rules.
  - `DEFAULT_SFC_RULES` and `DEFAULT_SUPPRESSION_RULES`.

  Every one of these duplicated a facet preset in `@zintljs/compiler/facets`, which is now the single source of truth. The Vue and Svelte block rules were byte-identical to their preset counterparts.

  **Removed the one live leak.** `parser.ts` fell back to `DEFAULT_SFC_RULES` whenever the caller's rules did not cover a file's extension, so any `.vue` or `.svelte` file received Vue/Svelte block-splitting from the extractor itself even when no rules were supplied. SFC rules are now caller-supplied only.

  **`TargetDescriptor` no longer names a framework.** The `"auto" | "react" | "nextjs" | "vue" | "svelte" | "html" | "vanilla"` members are gone, leaving only the structural forms (`jsx:*:attr`, `jsx:El:attr`, `dom:prop:x`, `dom:attr:x`, `obj:field:x`, `html:attr:x`) and `TargetPlugin`. `resolveTargets` is correspondingly reduced to pure structural compilation — descriptors into lookup sets, plugin collection and a fast-path regex — with no preset expansion and no rule derivation.

  **No default target set.** `parser.ts` and `context.ts` both defaulted to `["vanilla", "react", "html"]`. A framework-blind executor has nothing sensible to guess, so callers now declare their sinks; production supplies a fully compiled state from the resolved facets.

  **Removed dead sink opinions.** `DEFAULT_UI_ATTRIBUTES`, `DEFAULT_UI_OBJECT_FIELDS`, `DEFAULT_UI_SINK_PROPERTIES` and `TEMPLATE_ATTR_REGEX` encoded which DOM and JSX attributes are translatable. All four were already unreferenced — one survived only inside a commented-out line.

  **Fixed drifted runtime-specifier detection.** The check for Zintl's own module specifiers was inlined at four sites (`parser.ts`, two in `visitors/program.ts`, one in `visitors/bindings.ts`) and the copies had diverged: the `bindings.ts` variant omitted the bare `"zintl"` literal, so a project configuring a custom `runtimePackage` would have had bare `"zintl"` imports recognised by three checks and missed by the fourth. All four now call the new `isRuntimeSpecifier` helper, backed by a single `RUNTIME_SPECIFIERS` list.

  **Verification.** The contract snapshots passed with zero diffs, which is the proof that the deleted tables were dead in production. Three new architecture tests assert that the extractor names no framework anywhere in its source, exposes no preset tables, and that `resolveTargets([])` yields a genuinely empty world.

- e1e504d: Prepare the packages for their first public release.

  - **Renamed the npm scope** from `@zintl/*` to `@zintljs/*`. The `zintl` org name was unavailable on npm; the primary package remains `zintl`, so application code importing `zintl` and `zintl/macro` is unaffected. Only direct consumers of `@zintl/compiler` and `@zintl/extractor` need to update.
  - **Corrected the Vite peer range** to `^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0 || ^8.0.0`, verified by building a real app against stock Vite 6.4.3, 7.3.6, and 8.2.0. The plugin relies on the Environment API (`hotUpdate`, `this.environment`), which does not exist in Vite 5, so the previous `^5.0.0` range advertised support that could never work.
  - **Pinned `oxc-parser` and `@oxc-project/types`** to `^0.142.0` in the workspace catalog. They were set to `latest`, which would have published `@zintljs/extractor` with an unpinned runtime dependency on a pre-1.0 parser.
  - **Trimmed the publish surface** with an explicit `files` field. The `zintl` tarball drops from 91 files (535 kB unpacked) to 13 files (103 kB) — build config and sources are no longer shipped.
  - **Added `engines`, `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, and `keywords`** to every published package, and gave `@zintljs/compiler` and `@zintljs/extractor` their own READMEs.
  - **Moved npm provenance out of `publishConfig`** so that publishing is possible outside of CI. Provenance requires a public source repository and CI OIDC; it is re-enabled via `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE` in the release workflow.
  - **Marked `@zintljs/testing` as private.** It backs the internal e2e suite only and is no longer part of the release surface.

### Patch Changes

- a7f080f: Fully decoupled high-level framework presets (`"vue"`, `"svelte"`, and `"nextjs"`) from `@zintljs/extractor`'s core logic. The extractor has no hardcoded references to these framework target-presets, meaning all SFC block parsing rules, metadata suppression rules, and mustache regular expression patterns now flow downward from compiler-resolved adapters.

  Evolved the extractor's mustache rule matcher to dynamically match intermediate or virtual file extensions (e.g. `.vue.html` and `.svelte.html`) to ensure correct template variable extraction and production catalog baking in Vue and Svelte.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- 85504fe: Refactor extractor fast-path and boundary assignment to be fully driven by configuration and structure, removing all sink-based speculation.

  **Fast-path & Target-Driven Optimizations**:

  - **`types.ts`**: Added `"nextjs"` as a supported `TargetDescriptor`.
  - **`targets.ts`**: Introduced the `"nextjs"` target preset (which inherits standard JSX/object field rules). Completely eliminated framework-specific target flags (`isReactTarget`, `isVueTarget`, `isSvelteTarget`, `isNextjsTarget`) from `ResolvedTargets`.
  - **`context.ts`**: Removed the target boolean flags from `ExtractionContext`, resolving rule sets (like `mustacheRegex`) dynamically using configuration target presets and extension-based fallbacks.
  - **`parser.ts`**: Replaced the hardcoded `isLikelyUI` check with `resolved.fastPathRegex.test(code)`.
  - **`visitors/index.ts`**: Conditionally mount the JsxVisitor only when JSX targets are active.
  - **`visitors/bindings.ts`**: Conditionally register AST hooks for `AssignmentExpression` (only if DOM targets are active) and `Property` (only if object fields are configured), bypassing expensive node checks.
  - **`visitors/program.ts`**: Decoupled Next.js metadata/viewport export suppression logic from standard React projects, gating it dynamically via the target suppression metadata rules.
  - **`html.ts`**: Optimized mustache template parsing by using target flags, and refined SFC template checks using path extensions combined with targets to prevent stripping the `htmlProjection` metadata on top-level static HTML entry pages (like `index.html`).
  - **`hooks/config.ts`**: Added auto-detection for the `"nextjs"` framework when `"next"` or `"vinext"` is detected in package dependencies or plugin lists.

  **Declarative Extractor Languages (Knowledge Zeroing)**:

  - **SFC Segmentation Language**: Added `SfcRule` and `SfcBlockRule` interfaces. Extractor now splits Vue, Svelte, and Astro SFC files using fully custom, declarative regex-based block segmentation rules instead of hardcoded splitters.
  - **AST Suppression Language**: Added `SuppressionRule` interface. Extractor AST walker checks nodes generically against configurable suppression criteria (matching types, names, and root-level scopes) to bypass zero-config extraction on server-only subtrees.
  - **Generic Parsers**: HTML extraction and AST visitors are decoupled from framework file extension checks, dynamically utilizing the resolved rules (such as `mustacheRegex` and `activeRange`/`isSfcTemplate` for HTML template stitching).

  **Boundary assignment (structural)**:

  - **Removed `hasSinksOrCalls`**: The recursive subtree walk that speculatively assigned sub-boundaries to any function with UI sinks is gone. It was a second tree traversal inside the first walk and relied on framework-specific hardcoded checks (`["innerHTML", "innerText"]`, unconditional JSX node checks).
  - **Replaced with structural rule**: Every top-level **exported** function gets its own sub-boundary deterministically — no sink scan required. The compiler's binding tracker uses these to attribute strings precisely when a consumer imports only a subset of a file's exports. In zero-config mode, all top-level functions (including non-exported) get sub-boundaries, mirroring the existing fast-path behavior.
  - **Local functions** (non-exported, no explicit `zintl()` anchor) now correctly collapse to the file's root boundary. The compiler's boundary graph handles reachability at the file level.

  **Effect**: The extractor now has two sources of truth for boundaries — explicit `zintl()` anchors and structural exports — with no guessing about sink content. Framework knowledge lives entirely in `ExtractionOptions.targets`.

- 0bd00a8: Fix evaluation of dynamic attributes, tag replacement, and boundary resolution in JSX/SFC compilation:

  - **Export and Import Boundary Resolution**:
    - In `@zintl/extractor`: Maps default and named exports of components to their precise function-level boundary IDs (e.g., `src/App:App` instead of the file boundary `src/App`) in the program visitor.
    - In `@zintl/compiler`: Resolves static import bindings to their precise exported function-level boundary IDs when walking the dependency graph in `intent-utils.ts`, and adds file-level fallback resolution to ownership mapping checks.
  - **Dynamic JSX Attribute Evaluation**: Serializes `_tags` for JSX components as raw JavaScript array literals rather than JSON strings, allowing local scope variables (like imported assets) to be correctly evaluated at runtime.
  - **JSX to HTML Attribute Mapping**: Automatically maps `className` to `class`, and JSX attribute expressions like `src={logo}` to template literal interpolations `src="${logo}"` for elements inside translated templates.
  - **Self-Closing Tag Placeholders**: Extends the runtime key resolver and compile-time baking to support self-closing tags (both `<tag/>` and `<tag />`) when replacing translatable element placeholders.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- Updated external dependencies:
  - @types/node@^24.12.4
  - typescript@^5.9.3

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- 776aca8: Introduce Single File Component (SFC) extraction/transformation for Vue and Svelte, automatic target resolution, and performance optimizations:
  - **SFC Extraction Support**: Added support for `.vue` and `.svelte` templates and scripts in `@zintl/extractor`. Implemented script block slicing, tag stripping, and position/offset translation for variables, transforms, and locations to map them correctly back to the original source file.
  - **Vue & Svelte Target Presets**: Expanded Target Presets to include comprehensive configurations for Vue and Svelte elements (e.g., translatable attributes like `alt`, `placeholder`, `aria-label`).
  - **Dynamic HTML & Attribute Wrapping**: Added support for SFC-aware rewriting in `@zintl/compiler`. HTML text nodes with dynamic nested tags are automatically wrapped in framework-specific logic (`<span v-html="...">` for Vue, `{@html ...}` for Svelte), and normal text interpolations map to `{{ ... }}` or `{ ... }`. HTML attributes are transformed into reactive bindings (`:attr="..."` or `attr={...}`).
  - **Automatic Target Detection**: Added an `auto` option to the plugin targets. It dynamically queries the project `package.json` dependencies and Vite plugin configurations to auto-configure appropriate extraction targets.
  - **Compiler Flush Performance Recovery**: Optimized the compiler's warm-path flush latency to resolve benchmark regression:
    - Cached the reachable graph nodes in `ZintlCompiler` (`reachableCache`) to avoid repetitive DFS traversals per locale/boundary.
    - Implemented string comparison caching (`lastManifestContent`) for metadata manifests in `MessageManager` to bypass redundant disk writes/reads.
    - Bypassed empty synchronization tasks for assets and HTML projections when there are no updates.
    - Added on-disk verification caching (`confirmedOnDisk`) for catalogs and schemas to avoid multiple expensive `fs.exists` checks on subsequent rebuilds.
  - **Vite Transform Query Safety**: Configured the transform hook in the Vite plugin to skip transforming modules containing query parameters unless they are explicitly tagged with `zintl-multiplex=`, avoiding conflicts with non-JS file assets.
  - **ICU Baker Warnings**: Refined ICU message checking warnings to bypass mustache expressions (`{{ ... }}`) and focus warnings only on actual syntax errors.

### Patch Changes

- 18a7166: Added support for inline SVG elements during HTML/JSX parsing and resolved fanned routing redirect intercepts in development mode:

  - **SVG Phrasing Elements Support**: Added common SVG child tags (`use`, `path`, `circle`, `rect`, `g`, etc.) to the list of inline phrasing tags. This prevents HTML/JSX text stitching from partitioning at unrecognized sub-tags, eliminating unmatched closing tag validation errors and schema warnings during catalog compilation.
  - **Fanned Routing Support in Dev Mode**: Updated the Vite development index HTML interception logic to inspect both the filesystem path and request path. This prevents custom SSR development servers from rendering empty redirect shells when navigating fanned localized routes.
  - **Request-Scoped SSR Compilation**: Restricted contextual anchor locale baking in the compiler transform when performing server-side builds. This ensures that multi-locale Express/custom SSR servers can generate request-scoped translations dynamically.

- 776aca8: Fix HTML catalog generation pollution in SFC templates, ignore only-variable text nodes, and optimize translation loader generation:
  - **SFC Catalog and Schema Sanitation**: Prevent `.vue` and `.svelte` files from being incorrectly identified as HTML document projections. This stops the creation of schema files and catalog files containing page-level settings (like `dir`) for SFCs.
  - **Variable-Only Text Node Omission**: Ignore text nodes inside Vue/Svelte SFC templates that only contain variables (e.g. `{{ l.name }}`), avoiding empty translation key generation (`"{var0}"`).
  - **Kingdom-Based Loader Optimization**: Optimize the compilation rewrite of the `zintl` macro. If a boundary manager (and all of its child boundaries/colony files) does not contain any translatable messages or asset dependencies, it is omitted from loader registration to minimize runtime initialization overhead.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- Introduce universal target presets, configurable assets mapping, and testing suites:

  - **Target Preset Customization**: Added framework target presets (`react`, `vanilla`, `html`) and a Target DSL in the extractor, allowing developers to configure translatable attributes, sinks, and object property targets.
  - **Universal Asset Targets (`assetsTarget`)**: Added support in the compiler for glob-based asset routing configurations, supporting strategy overrides (such as binary pass-through, text pass-through, frontmatter) and custom strategy callbacks.
  - **Catalog Group-by Path Routing**: Grouped asset catalogs by locale and original relative paths to prevent collisions across multiple files sharing identical basenames.
  - **Testing Verification**: Created dedicated unit test suites covering targets preset expansion, Target DSL parsing, resolver caching, extractor targets integration, and custom asset strategy callback execution.
  - **Decoupled Reference Calibration**: Decoupled the benchmark calibration step from extractor implementation, running it as a pure JS mathematical loop to stabilize execution speed measurements and prevent false budget regression alerts.

- **⚡ Performance Benchmark Changes Detected**:

  **Summary:** 🟢 1 benchmark(s) improved (normalized and calibrated against Reference Calibration machine-speed differences).

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- Rebranded the primary Vite plugin package from `@zintl/vite` to `zintl` to serve as the unified main entry point. Updated the compiler import resolution pipelines, extractor AST visitor patterns, configurations, and example imports to resolve and load from `zintl` and `zintl/macro`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Decoupled the runtime by relocating it from the Vite plugin and the old runtime packages directly into the compiler. The Vite plugin now dynamically resolves and loads the runtime (only when needed) as a virtualized module served from compiler-generated assets, while `@zintl/vite/macro` has been streamlined as a lean, zero-dependency facade.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- d2d7d9b: Optimize HTML and JSX extraction, phrasing-tag normalization, and comment directive handling:
  - **Nested Phrasing Tag Support**: Flawlessly parses and normalizes deeply nested phrasing tags (e.g., `<a>read <code>instructions</code></a>`) without disrupting tag open/close balances or generating malformed outputs.
  - **Transparent Phrasing Directives**: Allows HTML comment directives (`@zintl-note` and `@zintl-pass`) to live inside phrasing tag boundaries without partitioning the translatable string, propagating meta annotations seamlessly to translators.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Optimize HTML and JSX extraction and phrasing-tag normalization:
  - **Phrasing Tag Collapsing**: Collapses exactly identical phrasing tag configurations (e.g. identical `<span>` tags) to a single clean base alias, avoiding redundant numbering and duplicate entries in translation catalogs.
  - **Heterogeneous Tag Numbering**: Retains stable numbering (`span1`, `span2`) exclusively for tags that carry different classes, attributes, or IDs to preserve translation safety.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Normalize Windows-style CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings to LF (`\n`) at the start of both JS/TS and HTML extraction pipelines. This guarantees platform-independence and prevents range/offset alignment mismatches.
