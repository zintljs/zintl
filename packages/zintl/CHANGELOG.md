# zintl

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 2a07272: Introduced a modular, conflict-free **Adapter Architecture** that decouples framework-specific and toolchain-specific capabilities into discrete concerns. Framework presets (`"react"`, `"vue"`, `"svelte"`, `"vanilla"`, `"html"`, `"nextjs"`) and runtime/bundler layers (`"ssr"`, `"vite"`, `"client-spa"`) compose dynamically into a resolved capabilities map. Key changes include:

  - **Environmental Runtime Splitting**: Decomposed `store.ts` into environment-gated modules (`store-core.ts`, `store-client.ts`, and `store-server.ts`). Vanilla applications now bundle only core translation states, while SPA router synchronization popstates and server request-scoped `AsyncLocalStorage` logic are loaded dynamically on demand.
  - **Vite Plugin Decoupling**: Refactored the Vite plugin config hook to utilize the compiler's presets engine, auto-injecting the `"vite"` preset and detected frameworks, which cleans up hundreds of lines of duplicate codegen and SSR wrapper regexes.
  - **Extension Preservation**: Retained full source file extensions (like `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.svelte`, and `.vue`) in the boundary ID normalization and compiler maps to prevent naming clashes between files sharing the same base name.
  - **Boundary & Catalog Alignment**: Resolved a bug causing duplicate catalog and schema files (e.g. `App.ar.json` vs `App.svelte.ar.json`) by passing pre-resolved extensions and adapters directly to the `IOManager` constructor to unify normalized paths.
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Embedded fallback translation from `options.targets` to their preset adapters to ensure full compatibility with existing configuration blocks.

- 448dbc6: Gave Zintl's option defaults a single home. Defaults were previously applied lazily at roughly thirty read sites across two packages, several of them duplicated with divergent rules, so answering "where did this value come from?" meant grepping.

  **`resolveOptions()` is now real.** It had been a stub whose entire body was commented out, returning `options || {}`. It now applies every context-free default once, at plugin creation, and `Context` holds the resulting `ResolvedOptions` so downstream hooks read concrete values. A new exported `DEFAULTS` table is the one place a default is written down.

  | default                               | occurrences before | after            |
  | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
  | `locales \|\| ["en"]`                 | 9                  | 0                |
  | `sourceLocale \|\| "en"` (plugin)     | 4                  | 0                |
  | `similarityThreshold ?? 0.6` literals | 3                  | 0                |
  | `["md", "txt"]` literals              | 2                  | 1 named constant |
  | harness default blocks                | 2                  | 1                |

  **Three defaults stay unresolved on purpose**, because only Vite can supply them. Each is documented in `DEFAULTS` and applied at exactly one site: `multiplex` (`undefined` → auto-detect by scanning entry files), `verifyIntegrity` (`undefined` → on for `build`, off for `serve`) and `logLevel` (`undefined` → fall back to Vite's own, then `"info"`). `logLevel` previously had three stacked defaulting layers and `verifyIntegrity` three rules that disagreed, one of which relied on spread ordering to let a user value win.

  `outputDir`, `catalogFormat`, `metadataDir` and `similarityThreshold` are deliberately left unset by the plugin so the compiler applies its own — re-stating them would recreate the duplication being removed.

  **Fixed a shared-array aliasing bug** found while writing the new tests: the default `locales` array was a single instance handed to every caller, so one plugin instance mutating its locale list would corrupt another's. Array defaults are now copied per call.

  **Compiler-side deduplication.** `DEFAULT_RENAME_THRESHOLD` is exported from `reconcile.ts` and reused by the assets facet, which had hardcoded `0.6` three times. The assets facet's `["md", "txt"]` default is a named constant instead of two inline literals. `AssetFacetConfig` drops its `assetsTarget` alias, so the concept is spelled `targets` at the facet level and `assetsTarget` at the plugin level, bridged in exactly one commented line in `facets/assemble.ts` — previously three spellings reconciled by a rename inside the factory. `IOManager` takes a narrow `IOManagerOptions` (just `metadataDir`) rather than the whole `CompilerOptions`, and its duplicated metadata-directory resolution is collapsed into one method.

  **Removed dead configuration.** The `ZINTL_TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` / `ZINTL_TEST_METADATA_DIR` environment overrides were read in `configResolved` but nothing in the repository ever set them. The test harness's Vite alias pointing at `packages/runtime/src/*` referenced a directory that does not exist.

  **New coverage** for territory that had none: `resolveOptions` pins every documented default and asserts that falsy user values survive, and `flattenFacets` / `autoFacets` / `assembleFacets` are tested directly — including that `viteFacet()` is always injected and that the generic SSR facet is never paired with Next.js, which would otherwise be a facet conflict.

- 4031237: Consolidated the facet configuration and instantiation pattern. Replaced static facet objects and custom creation helpers with standardized function factories named `nameFacet(options?)` (e.g., `vanillaFacet()`, `assetsFacet()`, `viteFacet()`). Introduced compound facet factories (e.g., `reactFacet()`, `vueFacet()`, `htmlFacet()`, `nextjsFacet()`, and `ssrFacet()`) to return a flattened list of concerns under a single configuration entry. Relocated all preset automation and auto-resolution logic from the compiler core to the Vite plugin, making the compiler entirely logicless. Finally, renamed `ZintlOptions` to `CompilerOptions`, and re-exported all facet factories directly from the `zintl` plugin package so users do not need to install the compiler package to customize facets.
- 5be8d95: Moved facet resolution out of the compiler and into the host plugin, completing the separation the Concern-Faceted Architecture was aiming at. Knowledge now flows one way only: `extractor ← compiler (core) ← compiler/facets ← zintl (plugin)`. The compiler receives capabilities and executes them; it no longer selects, merges, validates or names a framework.

  **Compiler API.** `new ZintlCompiler(options)` now requires `options.capabilities`. `CompilerOptions.facets` and the internal `CompilerFacetInput` type are removed, and `resolveFacets` is no longer exported from `@zintljs/compiler`.

  ```ts
  // before
  new ZintlCompiler({ facets: [reactFacet(), viteFacet()] });

  // after
  import { resolveFacets } from "zintl/facets";
  new ZintlCompiler({
    capabilities: resolveFacets([...reactFacet(), viteFacet()]),
  });
  ```

  **Capability contract relocated to the compiler core.** All facet interfaces moved from `src/facet/types.ts` to `src/types/capabilities.ts` and are published from the package root. Renames: `ResolvedFacets` → `CompilerCapabilities`, `ResolvedCapabilities` → `CapabilityFlags`, `ResolvedFacetSystem` → `CompilerSystemView`. The bundle's boolean map is now reached as `capabilities.flags` rather than `capabilities.capabilities`.

  **Removed the `VITEST` facet injection.** The constructor silently pushed `htmlFacet()`, `assetsFacet()`, `vanillaFacet()` and `reactFacet()` whenever `VITEST=true` or `NODE_ENV=test`, so the compiler behaved differently under test than in production. This is why no compiler test ever passed a facet list. The facet set is now declared explicitly by the test harness.

  **Fixes uncovered by the move:**

  - **`ZintlFacet` was declared twice**, once in `dist/index.d.mts` and once in `dist/facet/index.d.mts`. Because `CompilerContext` reaches `IOManager` — a class with private fields — the two declarations were _nominally_ incompatible, which is what forced `as FacetsInput` casts on user-authored facets. `@zintljs/compiler/facets` now exports preset values only and imports the single canonical type declaration; the casts are no longer needed.
  - **The compiler hardcoded React.** `pipeline/resolve-imports.ts` injected `import { useSyncExternalStore } from "react"` for client components. Frameworks now declare this through the new `CodegenFacet.clientReactivityImports` field.
  - **`CatalogManager` and `GraphManager` hardcoded** `[".tsx", ".jsx", ".ts", ".js", ".vue", ".svelte", ".html"]` when probing extensionless dependency ids; both now use the resolved extension list, exposed via `IOManager.resolvedExtensions`.
  - **`resolveTargets` returns a shared, memoized object** that the old resolver mutated in place, so two compilers with identical descriptors but different facet rules could clobber each other's extraction state. The new `compileExtractionState` export (also the seam that keeps the plugin free of an `@zintljs/extractor` dependency) builds the state immutably.
  - **`MergeState.hmrInjectionCode`** dropped the `hasAnchors` parameter that both `BundlerFacet` and the resolved view declare.

  **Removed two unreachable bundler hooks.** `BundlerFacet.isMultiplex` had no provider and was shadowed by `Context.getMultiplex`. `BundlerFacet.fanBuildInputs` was not merely unused but architecturally unreachable: MPA input fanning happens in the `config` hook, which runs before `configResolved` constructs the compiler, so a facet's copy could never be consulted.

  **Plugin.** `zintl/facets` now exports `resolveFacets`, plus `assembleFacets`, `autoFacets`, `flattenFacets`, `detectFrameworks`, `detectFrameworksOrFallback` and `FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK`. Framework detection and facet assembly moved out of `configResolved` into `facets/detect.ts` and `facets/assemble.ts`, leaving the hook as three visible steps: detect → assemble → resolve. The plugin's public `Options` now extends `Omit<CompilerOptions, "capabilities">`.

  **`@zintljs/testing`.** `ViteDriver.compile()` resolves capabilities the same way the plugin does instead of handing plugin-shaped options straight to the compiler. The contract snapshots consequently measure the production path for the first time — which revealed that `vue-basic` and `svelte-basic` had been asserting that Zintl performs _no_ transformation on Vue and Svelte components (the test-mode injection gave every example React facets), and that `react-basic`, `react-ssr` and `vanilla-spa-basic` were recorded with no bundler facet at all, so dev dynamic imports lacked their `/* @vite-ignore */` comment. 15 snapshots were regenerated against the correct output.

  **Enforcement.** Two architecture tests assert that no file under `src/index.ts`, `src/pipeline/`, `src/managers/` or `src/types/` imports from `./facet/**`, and that the compiler core names no framework or bundler. The 42 test files that require a resolved framework world moved to the plugin package, where resolution lives.

- 1061058: Refactored the compiler extension model from Adapters to Facets, formalizing the Concern-Faceted Compiler Architecture and Dimension-Constrained composition system. Renamed `ZintlAdapter` to `ZintlFacet`, `resolveAdapters` to `resolveFacets`, and the `adapters` configuration options to `facets` across the compiler, plugin, examples, and tests.
- e1e504d: Prepare the packages for their first public release.

  - **Renamed the npm scope** from `@zintl/*` to `@zintljs/*`. The `zintl` org name was unavailable on npm; the primary package remains `zintl`, so application code importing `zintl` and `zintl/macro` is unaffected. Only direct consumers of `@zintl/compiler` and `@zintl/extractor` need to update.
  - **Corrected the Vite peer range** to `^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0 || ^8.0.0`, verified by building a real app against stock Vite 6.4.3, 7.3.6, and 8.2.0. The plugin relies on the Environment API (`hotUpdate`, `this.environment`), which does not exist in Vite 5, so the previous `^5.0.0` range advertised support that could never work.
  - **Pinned `oxc-parser` and `@oxc-project/types`** to `^0.142.0` in the workspace catalog. They were set to `latest`, which would have published `@zintljs/extractor` with an unpinned runtime dependency on a pre-1.0 parser.
  - **Trimmed the publish surface** with an explicit `files` field. The `zintl` tarball drops from 91 files (535 kB unpacked) to 13 files (103 kB) — build config and sources are no longer shipped.
  - **Added `engines`, `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, and `keywords`** to every published package, and gave `@zintljs/compiler` and `@zintljs/extractor` their own READMEs.
  - **Moved npm provenance out of `publishConfig`** so that publishing is possible outside of CI. Provenance requires a public source repository and CI OIDC; it is re-enabled via `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE` in the release workflow.
  - **Marked `@zintljs/testing` as private.** It backs the internal e2e suite only and is no longer part of the release surface.

### Patch Changes

- 3fd61d3: Ensure deterministic boundary and chunk graph serialization by implementing deterministic sorting helpers:

  - **Deterministic Serialization**: Added the `serializeDeterministic` utility to recursively format and sort `Map` keys, `Set` elements, and arrays of objects (such as `BoundaryDep` lists) by stable properties (e.g. `id` or `name`).
  - **Strict ESLint Compliance**: Included a localized string comparison helper `compareStrings` to satisfy array sort checks without the performance overhead of Unicode-based `localeCompare`.
  - **Contract Tests Snapshot Stability**: Updated the contract graph test suite to utilize the new deterministic serializer, preventing random reordering failures on successive test runs.

- fdda8fa: Refactored the compiler and Vite plugin wrapper to establish a fully adapter-driven modular architecture. Eliminated hardcoded fallbacks for extensions in the plugin wrapper config resolved hooks. Preserved physical JSON catalog formats for robust schema-enforcements, auto-healing, and recovery. Added support for custom Handlebars SFC template block extraction and dynamic runtime multi-brand slogans resolution, utilizing robust regex rewriter hooks. Added type definitions for SFC identification on codegen contributions. Unified the HTML projection preset adapter with the compiler's extraction manifest to merge standard extracted text keys and metadata (such as titles, descriptions, and directions) into the generated schemas, resolving validation conflicts under `additionalProperties: false`.
- 72acaa8: Expanded SSR entry point file extension matching in the compiler presets to support JSX/TSX:

  - **SSR JSX/TSX Entry Wrapping**: Added support for `.tsx` and `.jsx` file extensions when detecting and wrapping server entry points inside `runInRequestScope` in the `ssr` and `nextjs` presets.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- a16cedd: Evolved the compiler to be completely framework-agnostic (zero-knowledge) by eliminating all default `.vue` and `.svelte` fallbacks from the core extensions and search paths. Configured the host Vite plugin to dynamically calculate target extensions and pass them to the compiler. Refactored the React target adapter matching rule to dynamically exclude registered SFC extensions and HTML files without hardcoding Vue or Svelte.

  Abstracted dynamic imports and virtual module paths inside the compiler. Added `resolveVirtualPath` and `dynamicImportTemplate` options callbacks, allowing any host bundler plugin to configure custom virtual namespaces (e.g. queries) and ignore-comments (e.g. webpackIgnore/vite-ignore) dynamically.

- b7a327e: Fixed HMR rendering issues and resolved timing race conditions during source translation updates:

  - Updated the translation resolver (`_t`) to immediately re-evaluate catalog lookups after synchronous self-registration, preventing blank rendering.
  - Propagated HMR timestamps (`lastHMRTimestamp`) on all invalidated virtual modules in `handleHotUpdate` to ensure Vite's `importAnalysis` rewrites imports with correct timestamp query parameters.
  - Introduced automated page auto-refresh (full-reload) for server-side (SSR) only boundaries and catalogs when modified.

- 97733bb: Fix phantom boundary integrity errors and phantom asset output for projects without a `zintl()` anchor:

  - **`verifyIntegrity` — phantom boundary guard** (`packages/compiler/src/index.ts`): Added an early exit when `bg.entries.size === 0` so that projects with no trust anchors (e.g. a freshly migrated Next.js / vinext app) no longer throw `[Zintl Integrity Error]` for strings extracted by the aggressive stitching engine. When anchors do exist, tightened `isReachable` to check actual reachability from an entry point via `getStaticDependencyTree` instead of mere membership in `bg.nodes`, so phantom boundaries that live outside the anchor dependency chain are silently skipped rather than integrity-checked.

  - **`AssetManager` — phantom asset write guard** (`packages/compiler/src/managers/AssetManager.ts`): Extended `isAssetUsed()` with a boundary graph anchor check that fires only when real Vite module-graph information is available. If the Vite dep graph is populated but `bg.entries.size === 0`, the asset is classified as a phantom and `syncSingleAsset()` returns early without writing any localized output file. In isolated mode (unit tests, programmatic API usage without a Vite instance) the dep graph is empty so the original "assume used" fallback is preserved, keeping all existing asset tests passing.

- a64c32c: Fixed React HMR support, nested entry point reachability checks, and documented the synchronous catalog injection behavior:

  - Corrected boundary graph reachability traversal (`isReachable`) to resolve file paths against target nodes, fixing HMR invalidation failures for nested/bootstrap anchors.
  - Documented the framework-agnostic Synchronous HMR Catalog Injection in `SPEC/ZHMR.md` which leverages Vite's execution order to update the active translation store before component re-renders, rendering manual store subscriptions obsolete.

- 0bd00a8: Fix evaluation of dynamic attributes, tag replacement, and boundary resolution in JSX/SFC compilation:

  - **Export and Import Boundary Resolution**:
    - In `@zintl/extractor`: Maps default and named exports of components to their precise function-level boundary IDs (e.g., `src/App:App` instead of the file boundary `src/App`) in the program visitor.
    - In `@zintl/compiler`: Resolves static import bindings to their precise exported function-level boundary IDs when walking the dependency graph in `intent-utils.ts`, and adds file-level fallback resolution to ownership mapping checks.
  - **Dynamic JSX Attribute Evaluation**: Serializes `_tags` for JSX components as raw JavaScript array literals rather than JSON strings, allowing local scope variables (like imported assets) to be correctly evaluated at runtime.
  - **JSX to HTML Attribute Mapping**: Automatically maps `className` to `class`, and JSX attribute expressions like `src={logo}` to template literal interpolations `src="${logo}"` for elements inside translated templates.
  - **Self-Closing Tag Placeholders**: Extends the runtime key resolver and compile-time baking to support self-closing tags (both `<tag/>` and `<tag />`) when replacing translatable element placeholders.

- a9942b8: Shared server-side AsyncLocalStorage and registry store context on globalThis to prevent request context leaks and hydration mismatches across RSC and SSR environments:

  - Shared request-scoped `storeStorage` (AsyncLocalStorage), `globalRegistry`, `defaultInstance`, and `currentInstance` on `globalThis` in the runtime compiler store to bridge the RSC and SSR execution scopes on the server.
  - Restored standard Vite HMR catalog hot updates by reverting the experimental full-reload trigger for catalog updates.
  - Improved the missing key warn log in translation resolver to print the target boundary ID (`targetBId`) instead of the manager ID.

- 8f51ff6: Added configuration-driven SSR/RSC request isolation support for virtual entry points, zero-config framework auto-detection, and robust URL parsing:

  - Added configuration properties `ssrEntryTargets`, `ssrWrapDefault`, and `ssrWrapExports` to `ZintlOptions` to support generic wrapping of entry points with `runInRequestScope`.
  - Added zero-config auto-detection and defaulting of SSR options (`ssrEntryTargets`, `ssrWrapDefault`, `ssrWrapExports`) for the `nextjs` target (e.g. Next.js / Vinext entries) when using the default target configuration.
  - Robustly extracted the locale from incoming request URLs containing protocols, hostnames, query parameters, or hashes during request-scoped store initialization in `runInRequestScope`.
  - Allowed transformation and request isolation wrapping on registered virtual entry targets (such as `virtual:vinext-rsc-entry` and `virtual:vinext-server-entry`) by bypassing extension and virtual module early returns in the compiler transform process.
  - Updated `zintl` Vite plugin config and transform hooks to forward the new parameters and allow processing of virtual module paths matching `ssrEntryTargets`.

- a6aabcf: Introduce **Virtual Assets Mode** (zero-disk asset reference compilation) to allow building and resolving localized static translation assets purely in memory:

  - **Virtual Assets Configuration**: Added the `virtualAssets?: boolean` option to compiler settings to bypass writing target files to the local filesystem during compilation.
  - **In-Memory Translation Registry**: Integrated localized catalog generation directly with the translation Hive, dynamically retrieving and fuzzy-matching translations virtualized in memory.
  - **Vite/Rollup Asset Emission**: Configured the plugin hooks to map target asset imports to virtual modules (`\0virtual:zintl/asset/...`), emitting optimized and hashed static assets directly via Rollup's `this.emitFile()` API.
  - **Support for raw text and binary loaders**: Supports loading virtualized text and Markdown files under standard and `?raw` loader streams, exporting translated strings as JS modules.

- 8aefe85: Refactor Vite plugin hooks (`resolveId`, `load`, and `transform`) to support Vite 6's Environment API (`this.environment`) for SSR detection, while maintaining backward compatibility with Vite 5 using fallback options.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- 365d1d2: Fix production SSR client hydration mismatch and Vue SFC multiplex caching:

  - Virtualize Vue and Svelte SFC paths by locale (e.g. `HelloWorld.zintl-ar.vue`) in `resolveIdHook` and `loadHook` to prevent descriptor caching collision in the SFC compilers.
  - Normalize localized virtual SFC paths back to clean original paths in `packages/compiler/src/managers/IOManager.ts`.
  - Allow relative imports within virtualized `.zintl-` SFCs to propagate their locale and get virtualized rather than returning raw clean paths immediately.
  - Skip processing Vue and Svelte virtual sub-requests in `loadHook` and `transformHook` to prevent overriding pre-compiled blocks with raw template blocks.
  - Trim catalog key matching and variable mustache lookups with padding preservation in the compiler pipeline to ensure translations match and preserve leading/trailing whitespace.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- 776aca8: Introduce Single File Component (SFC) extraction/transformation for Vue and Svelte, automatic target resolution, and performance optimizations:
  - **SFC Extraction Support**: Added support for `.vue` and `.svelte` templates and scripts in `@zintl/extractor`. Implemented script block slicing, tag stripping, and position/offset translation for variables, transforms, and locations to map them correctly back to the original source file.
  - **Vue & Svelte Target Presets**: Expanded Target Presets to include comprehensive configurations for Vue and Svelte elements (e.g., translatable attributes like `alt`, `placeholder`, `aria-label`).
  - **Dynamic HTML & Attribute Wrapping**: Added support for SFC-aware rewriting in `@zintl/compiler`. HTML text nodes with dynamic nested tags are automatically wrapped in framework-specific logic (`<span v-html="...">` for Vue, `{@html ...}` for Svelte), and normal text interpolations map to `{{ ... }}` or `{ ... }`. HTML attributes are transformed into reactive bindings (`:attr="..."` or `attr={...}`).
  - **Automatic Target Detection**: Added an `auto` option to the plugin targets. It dynamically queries the project `package.json` dependencies and Vite plugin configurations to auto-configure appropriate extraction targets.
  - **Compiler Flush Performance Recovery**: Optimized the compiler's warm-path flush latency to resolve benchmark regression:
    - Cached the reachable graph nodes in `ZintlCompiler` (`reachableCache`) to avoid repetitive DFS traversals per locale/boundary.
    - Implemented string comparison caching (`lastManifestContent`) for metadata manifests in `MessageManager` to bypass redundant disk writes/reads.
    - Bypassed empty synchronization tasks for assets and HTML projections when there are no updates.
    - Added on-disk verification caching (`confirmedOnDisk`) for catalogs and schemas to avoid multiple expensive `fs.exists` checks on subsequent rebuilds.
  - **Vite Transform Query Safety**: Configured the transform hook in the Vite plugin to skip transforming modules containing query parameters unless they are explicitly tagged with `zintl-multiplex=`, avoiding conflicts with non-JS file assets.
  - **ICU Baker Warnings**: Refined ICU message checking warnings to bypass mustache expressions (`{{ ... }}`) and focus warnings only on actual syntax errors.

### Patch Changes

- 18a7166: Bypassed code transformations and catalog generation/pruning for non-zintlized files and projects:

  - **Bypass Transformations for Non-Zintlized Projects**: Updated the compiler transform pipeline to check for the presence of Zintl entry points/anchors in the project, completely skipping AST transforms and manager injection for projects with zero active entry points (like the `vanilla-ssr` example).
  - **Conditional Vitest Testing Support**: Allowed unit tests checking isolated transforms to continue running in Vitest by identifying test environment file contexts and selectively bypassing the anchor-check.
  - **Dynamic Catalog Restriction**: Updated the catalog manager to skip syncing and pruning boundary catalogs when zero active entry points exist.
  - **Test Coverage**: Added dedicated unit test coverage verifying that non-zintlized source files with UI sinks remain untransformed when no Zintl entry points are present.

- 18a7166: Added support for inline SVG elements during HTML/JSX parsing and resolved fanned routing redirect intercepts in development mode:

  - **SVG Phrasing Elements Support**: Added common SVG child tags (`use`, `path`, `circle`, `rect`, `g`, etc.) to the list of inline phrasing tags. This prevents HTML/JSX text stitching from partitioning at unrecognized sub-tags, eliminating unmatched closing tag validation errors and schema warnings during catalog compilation.
  - **Fanned Routing Support in Dev Mode**: Updated the Vite development index HTML interception logic to inspect both the filesystem path and request path. This prevents custom SSR development servers from rendering empty redirect shells when navigating fanned localized routes.
  - **Request-Scoped SSR Compilation**: Restricted contextual anchor locale baking in the compiler transform when performing server-side builds. This ensures that multi-locale Express/custom SSR servers can generate request-scoped translations dynamically.

- 18a7166: Added support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) request context isolation and automatic client-side locale inheritance:

  - **SSR Request Scope Isolation**: Integrated compile-time wrapping of the server entry point's exported `render` function inside `runInRequestScope` to prevent request state pollution.
  - **Client Locale Inheritance**: Added client-side oracle mechanism to automatically read and hydrate locale from `document.documentElement.lang`.
  - **Sequential Runtime Builds**: Updated build commands for packaging compiler runtime targets sequentially, avoiding shared chunk collision in virtual imports.
  - **Idempotency Guard**: Added protection in compiler transform to prevent double-wrapping render exports if transformed multiple times during build execution.
  - **Redirect Loop Resolution**: Added path check guards in the client-side redirect script to prevent infinite redirect loops on fanned locale endpoints.
  - **SSR appType Support**: Bypassed DevServer HTML-interception middleware when Vite configuration specifies `appType: "custom"`, allowing Express/custom SSR servers to manage routing and server-side redirection cleanly.

- 776aca8: Fix HTML catalog generation pollution in SFC templates, ignore only-variable text nodes, and optimize translation loader generation:

  - **SFC Catalog and Schema Sanitation**: Prevent `.vue` and `.svelte` files from being incorrectly identified as HTML document projections. This stops the creation of schema files and catalog files containing page-level settings (like `dir`) for SFCs.
  - **Variable-Only Text Node Omission**: Ignore text nodes inside Vue/Svelte SFC templates that only contain variables (e.g. `{{ l.name }}`), avoiding empty translation key generation (`"{var0}"`).
  - **Kingdom-Based Loader Optimization**: Optimize the compilation rewrite of the `zintl` macro. If a boundary manager (and all of its child boundaries/colony files) does not contain any translatable messages or asset dependencies, it is omitted from loader registration to minimize runtime initialization overhead.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- Introduce universal target presets, configurable assets mapping, and testing suites:

  - **Target Preset Customization**: Added framework target presets (`react`, `vanilla`, `html`) and a Target DSL in the extractor, allowing developers to configure translatable attributes, sinks, and object property targets.
  - **Universal Asset Targets (`assetsTarget`)**: Added support in the compiler for glob-based asset routing configurations, supporting strategy overrides (such as binary pass-through, text pass-through, frontmatter) and custom strategy callbacks.
  - **Catalog Group-by Path Routing**: Grouped asset catalogs by locale and original relative paths to prevent collisions across multiple files sharing identical basenames.
  - **Testing Verification**: Created dedicated unit test suites covering targets preset expansion, Target DSL parsing, resolver caching, extractor targets integration, and custom asset strategy callback execution.
  - **Decoupled Reference Calibration**: Decoupled the benchmark calibration step from extractor implementation, running it as a pure JS mathematical loop to stabilize execution speed measurements and prevent false budget regression alerts.

- Updated dependencies
  - @zintl/compiler@0.1.0-alpha.2

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- Rebranded the primary Vite plugin package from `@zintl/vite` to `zintl` to serve as the unified main entry point. Updated the compiler import resolution pipelines, extractor AST visitor patterns, configurations, and example imports to resolve and load from `zintl` and `zintl/macro`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @zintl/compiler@0.1.0-alpha.1

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Decoupled the runtime by relocating it from the Vite plugin and the old runtime packages directly into the compiler. The Vite plugin now dynamically resolves and loads the runtime (only when needed) as a virtualized module served from compiler-generated assets, while `@zintl/vite/macro` has been streamlined as a lean, zero-dependency facade.

### Patch Changes

- Fix and optimize production build fanning hook forwarding and static asset multiplexing:

  - **Durable Plugin Getters**: Exposed `__options` and `__compiler` getters directly on the `mainPlugin` object so they survive Vite's internal plugin array flattening during production builds.
  - **Asset Multiplexing Isolation**: Bound multiplex query propagation exclusively to Zintl-eligible file extensions, preventing duplicate build output chunks for raw static assets.

- Updated dependencies
  - @zintl/compiler@0.0.1
